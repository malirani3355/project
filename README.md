Problem:
Spoofing detection approach a mechanism based on an analysis of how ‘alive’ a test face is. This is usually done by checking  movement, such as face motion.
 			
OBJECTIVES:
           To build a system with high accuracy which takes detection of  spoofing i.e Real and fake faces.
DATA DESCRIPTION:
               As we make the dataset of  real and fake images of faces for M.Sc.-II-year class, we take 100 images of each student in different angle. Statistics s there are 17 students thus we have total 3400 images of all students. 
Recognition method
Food Recognition deals with recognition of food item when given an image. For this problem I used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The Architecture of CNN given below figure python
